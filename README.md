## üè¥ What is Split-Targets?

Split-Targets is a **lightweight and flexible Python CLI tool** designed for security researchers, pentesters, and automation engineers who need to:

- Split large target files into smaller, manageable chunks  
- Remove duplicates across all chunks to avoid redundant scans  
- Automatically exclude specified IP prefixes and private IP ranges  
- Interactively decide whether to keep files in place, move, or copy them  
- Support very large chunk sizes for scalability  
- Run dry-runs to preview file splits without writing any output  

It‚Äôs simple to use yet packed with smart features to streamline your target preparation workflow.
